# Markdown Viewer and Demo
This folder contains a SynEdit derived simple Markdown viewer component and a demo project that
showcases its functionality.

The component supports the following Markdown syntax:
- Headers
- Horizontal rulers
- Emphasis tags (bold, italic and bold italic)
- Links
- Bullets
- Code tags (backticks)
- Paragraph formatting including the use of ```<br>```

It is by no means a full-blown Markdown viewer, but it could be sufficient in many situations
in which, using a Markdown processor with an HTML browser would be overkill.
The component also demonstrates the power of SynEdit indicators.
