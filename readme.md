## Installation

TurboPack SynEdit is available via the [GetIt Package Manager](http://docwiki.embarcadero.com/RADStudio/en/Installing_a_Package_Using_GetIt_Package_Manager) where you can quickly and easily install and uninstall it.

To manually install TurboPack SynEdit into your IDE, take the following
steps:

1. Unzip the release files into a directory (e.g., d:\SynEdit).

2. Start RAD Studio.

3. Add the **Source** and the **Source\Highlighters** subdirectories to the IDE's library path. For CBuilder, add the hpp subdirectory
(e.g., d:\SynEdit\source\hpp\Win32\Release) to the IDE's system include path.

4. Open & install the design-time package specific to the IDE being used. The IDE should notify you the components have been
installed.
