steps:

1. Unzip the release files into a directory (e.g., d:\SynEdit).

2. Start RAD Studio.

3. Add the **Source** and the **Source\Highlighters** subdirectories to the IDE's library path. For CBuilder, add the hpp subdirectory

4. Open & install the design-time package specific to the IDE being used. The IDE should notify you the components have been
installed.
